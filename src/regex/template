A regex is used as a search pattern for strings. Using regex, we can find either a single match or multiple
matches as well. we can look for any king of match in a string e.g a simple character, a fixed string or any
complex pattern of characters such email, SSN or domain names.

1.Regular expressions
	Regular expressions are the key to powerful, flexible, and efficient text processing, It allow you to 
	describe and parse text. Regular expression can add, remove , isolate and generally fold, spindle, and mutilate 
	all kinds of text and data.
	
	1.1. Metacharacters and literals
	
	Full regular expressions are composed of two types of characters.
		- The special characters (like the * from the filename analogy) are called metacharacters
		- The rest are call literals, or normal text characters
	Regex gain usefullness from advanced expressive powers that their metacharacters provide. We can
	think of literal text acting as the words and metacharacters as the grammer. The words and 
	metacharacters as the grammar. The words are combined with grammar according to a set of rules
	to create an expression that communicates an idea
