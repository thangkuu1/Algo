/**
 * HashMap cannot contain duplicate keys.
 * HashMap allows multiple null values but only one null key.
 * HashMap is an unordered collection. It does not guarantee any specific order of the elements.
 * HashMap is not thread-safe. You must explicitly synchronize concurrent modifications to the HashMap.
 * Or you can use Collection.synchronizedMap(hashMap) to get the synchronized version of HashMap.
 * 
 * A value can be retrieved only using the associated key.
 * 
 * HashMap stores only object references. So primitives must be used with their corresponding wrapper.
 * Such as int.
 * will be stored as Integer.
 * HashMap implements Cloneable and Serializable interfaces.
